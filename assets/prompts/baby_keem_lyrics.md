(Verse 1)
Yeah, top tier, motion blur, can't see me
New whip, new chain, lookin' breezy
Two phones, one for the work, one for the freaky
Big steppin', don't trip, stay cheeky

(Chorus)
Okay, okay, the score's high, no debate
Hykeem flow, that's the ultimate state
New money, new problems, ain't no fakes
Only real ones ride, whatever it takes

(Verse 2)
Studio late night, mic on blast, no sleepin'
Brain on hyperdrive, secrets I'm keepin'
From the bottom, now the top, yeah, we leapin'
Every track a banger, my reputation's steepin'

(Chorus)
Okay, okay, the score's high, no debate
Hykeem flow, that's the ultimate state
New money, new problems, ain't no fakes
Only real ones ride, whatever it takes

(Bridge)
Uh, pressure on, still cool, no stress
Countin' up blessings, manifestin' success
They talkin' trash, but they don't know the process
Big moves only, ain't no time for less

(Outro)
Yeah, Keem, huh?
Two phones, huh?
Big steppin', big money, huh?
Let's go.
